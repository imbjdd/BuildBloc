## About The Project

A few days ago I had a problem: I was looking for hackathons near where I live (Paris, France) but couldn't find any updated lists. So I decided to solve the problem: the aim of the platform is to promote local hackathons and builders' communities.

## Built With

This project was made possible thanks to these incredible frameworks!

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Supabase](https://supabase.com/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* npm

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh
npm install
```

3. Enter your supabase API in `env.example`

```env
API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API'
```

## Usage

For hackathon organizers, you can list your hackathons on our platform.
For users, you can see the list of available hackathons near you.
